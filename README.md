# ciphers
Implementations of different ciphers, encryption/decryption, etc.

## How to Use

Encryption/decryption programs for each type of cipher are available in the corresponding directory. Use your favorite compiler to test them out.

Sample text is provided in `sample_text.txt`, with lowercase characters and whitespace only, and `sample_text_ascii.txt`, with alphanumeric characters, punctuation, and whitespace (text source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis)). Encrypted text appears in `encrypted.txt` and attempts to decrypt it appear in `decrypted.txt`.
